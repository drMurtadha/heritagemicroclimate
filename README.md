## Executive Summary

This research project aims to monitor the heritage architecture of a building or place identified by the local authority of Johor as a cultural and heritage site. The primary objective of this study is to develop a dashboard that can collect and display microclimate parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. of the site. The collected data will be used to assist the local authority in preparing preventive maintenance plans to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values.

The proposed research methodology involves the installation of sensors to collect the data, which will be analyzed using machine learning algorithms. The algorithms will identify trends and patterns in the data, which will be used to suggest appropriate preventive maintenance actions. The expected output of this study is a dashboard that provides real-time readings of the microclimate parameters and suggests maintenance actions based on the data analysis.

The outcome of this study is expected to be a significant contribution to the preservation of heritage sites in Johor. The dashboard's ability to suggest preventive maintenance actions based on data analysis will enable the local authority to develop more effective maintenance plans, thereby prolonging the life of the heritage site. The implications of this study are that it will enhance the management of heritage sites and ensure their longevity for future generations to enjoy.

## Problem Statement

The preservation of cultural heritage sites is a crucial task, and the lack of proper maintenance often leads to their gradual deterioration. Traditional methods of maintenance are often reactive, resulting in significant damage to the site before any action is taken. Therefore, there is a need for proactive measures that can detect potential issues and suggest preventive maintenance actions to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values. This research aims to address this problem by developing a dashboard that collects and displays microclimate parameters using machine learning algorithms to suggest appropriate preventive maintenance actions for the heritage site identified by the local authority of Johor Bahru.

## Hypothesis

The hypothesis for this research project is that by collecting and analyzing microclimate data using machine learning algorithms, it is possible to detect potential issues and suggest appropriate preventive maintenance actions that will help preserve the aesthetics and cultural values of heritage sites. The dashboard developed in this research will be able to provide real-time readings of microclimate parameters and suggest maintenance actions based on the data analysis, which will enable the local authority of Johor to develop more effective maintenance plans and ensure the longevity of the heritage site.

## Research Questions

1. How can microclimate parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed be effectively collected and analyzed using machine learning algorithms to assist in the maintenance of heritage sites?
2. What are the potential preventive maintenance actions that can be suggested based on the data analysis of the microclimate parameters?
3. How can the dashboard developed in this research project be designed to provide real-time readings of the microclimate parameters and suggest appropriate maintenance actions to preserve the aesthetics and cultural values of the heritage site?
4. What are the implications of using machine learning algorithms to monitor and preserve heritage architecture, and how can this approach be applied to other heritage sites in Johor and beyond?
